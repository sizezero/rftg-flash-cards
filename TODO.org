* Tasks TODO

A dynamic list of tasks that need to be done.  Old tasks will likely
be pruned so this shouldn't serve as a definitive history.

* DONE Initial Buttons with toast

basic layout:

counter restart
tile
good bad

add toast

* TODO Two modes

invisible succeed/fail buttons
pressing tile goes to phase two; makes s/f visible
restart tile goes to phase one; makes s/f invisible

* TODO Action

restart and startup makes a list of tiles
tiles displayed as text "d12" "w34"
success removes tile from list and displays next
failure moves tile to end of list and displays next

* TODO Random

Failed tiles are placed in the middle third.
If remaining tiles is < N then tile is placed at the end

* TODO Add art

Perhaps convert to reasonable png with previous app.
Load from resource dir

* TODO Add nice succeed, fail, restart buttons
